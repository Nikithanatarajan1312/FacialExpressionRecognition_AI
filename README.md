# FacialExpressionRecognition_AI

The goal of this project is to predict, from the video of a person’s face, which emotion the facial expression conveys. Human facial expressions can be easily classified into 7 basic emotions: happy, sad, surprise, fear, anger, disgust, and neutral.
Deep learning methods (convolutional neural networks) to identify the key seven human emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutrality is applied. 
The project is done using Keras, OpenCV and Flask.
